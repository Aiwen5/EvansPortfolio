    "overview": "The Fathom Summer Series was created to capture the essence of summer through a line of craft beers, each inspired by a distinct time of day. Designed for Canadian consumers, the series balances vibrant visuals with bilingual labeling to meet packaging standards while reflecting the adventurous and geometric identity of the Fathom brand.\n\nEach can showcases sharp, geometric fruit illustrations that align with Fathom’s brand style, emphasizing bold, clean shapes and lines. Brand cohesion was maintained by carrying this geometric aesthetic across all designs, complemented by a consistent line graphic that unifies the series. The flavours themselves—Dawn Rise (Blood Orange & Ginger Wheat Ale), Golden Hour (Mango & Pineapple Pale Ale), and Twilight Berry (Blackberry & Lavender Saison)—are inspired by the feelings of a summer day, capturing the energy of morning, the brightness of midday, and the calm of twilight. Custom iconography highlights flavour profiles such as crispness and malt, giving consumers an idea of the flavour profile and adding depth to the design.\n\nThis series stands out on shelves with its vibrant colors, bold graphics, and storytelling, inviting consumers to experience the adventure of summer through Fathom’s unique lens.",

    "overview": "This poster was created to honour jazz icons Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, blending retro and modern elements to pay tribute to their timeless legacy. The orange and purple color palette was chosen to reflect the original album artwork, creating a visual homage to their collaboration. The typeface used for their names draws inspiration from 1960s design trends while incorporating a contemporary twist, balancing nostalgia with modern aesthetics.\n\nTo integrate the sourced images seamlessly into the design, Coltrane and Ellington were posterized. This approach added elegance, enhanced balance, and unified the composition. The warm, dynamic visuals and bold typography create a striking design that captures the energy and sophistication of jazz. Perfect for music lovers and collectors, this poster serves as a fitting tribute to two of the greatest legends in jazz history.",

    "overview": "This motion graphic promotes an app that connects farmers with consumers for pre-ordering goods before market day. It opens with contrasting scenes of overstocked and understocked stalls, immediately highlighting the common challenges farmers face. The narrative then shifts to a farmer discovering the app, followed by consumers placing orders, showcasing how the app reduces waste and improves planning. The video uses bright, geometric visuals and playful animations to make the app feel approachable and user-friendly. Happy customers emphasize the app’s role in building community connections. A cheerful, folk-inspired soundtrack and friendly voiceover create an inviting tone. By visually demonstrating the app’s benefits in a simple, engaging way, the motion graphic effectively captures attention and encourages both farmers and consumers to use Local Harvest.",
