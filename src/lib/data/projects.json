    "overview": "This poster was created to honour jazz icons Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, blending retro and modern elements to pay tribute to their timeless legacy. The orange and purple color palette was chosen to reflect the original album artwork, creating a visual homage to their collaboration. The typeface used for their names draws inspiration from 1960s design trends while incorporating a contemporary twist, balancing nostalgia with modern aesthetics.\n\nTo integrate the sourced images seamlessly into the design, Coltrane and Ellington were posterized. This approach added elegance, enhanced balance, and unified the composition. The warm, dynamic visuals and bold typography create a striking design that captures the energy and sophistication of jazz. Perfect for music lovers and collectors, this poster serves as a fitting tribute to two of the greatest legends in jazz history.",

    "overview": "This motion graphic promotes an app that connects farmers with consumers for pre-ordering goods before market day. It opens with contrasting scenes of overstocked and understocked stalls, immediately highlighting the common challenges farmers face. The narrative then shifts to a farmer discovering the app, followed by consumers placing orders, showcasing how the app reduces waste and improves planning. The video uses bright, geometric visuals and playful animations to make the app feel approachable and user-friendly. Happy customers emphasize the app’s role in building community connections. A cheerful, folk-inspired soundtrack and friendly voiceover create an inviting tone. By visually demonstrating the app’s benefits in a simple, engaging way, the motion graphic effectively captures attention and encourages both farmers and consumers to use Local Harvest.",
